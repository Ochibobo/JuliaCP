## Notes
- A solver has 2 parts:
  - An initialization bit:
    - You post the constraint
    - Define the minimization fn
    - Define the maximization fn
    - Initilize the state manager
    - A propagation queue for constraints to propagate
  - A propagation API:
    - Schedule a constraint
    - Call the fixPoint algorithm
- The `fixPoint` algorithm pop's constraints and propagates them.
- Failure during fixPoint can occur when a constraint or domain of a variable throws an exception
- The `fixPoint` algorithm oughts to catch the exception and clear the `propagationQueue`.
  - Don't want them to propagate as one goes to another node in the search tree.
- When cleaning the queue, reset the status of the `scheduled` flag.
  - Then throw the exception.
- Move the solve function to the solver instead of having it with the search.
- The `schedule` method of a solver adds a constraint to the solver's propagation queue.
- The `propagate` method of a solver calls the propagate method of the constraint in question.
- The `post` method of a solver calls the `post` method the constraint in question.
