- Consider having elements of the SparseSet implement an indexing method that returns an integer representing their index
- `Index` array contains the position `p` of the value `v` in the `value` array.
  - Accessing the actual value is done by:
    - `values[index[p]]` = `v`
- A value is in the set if its `index` < `size`
- Implements:
  - Contains
  - Size
  - Min
  - Max
- Only need to save the size of the domain in the `SparseSet`
  - Restoration only entails moving the `size`
- Delegate some operations to the `StateSparseSet`
- Notice that the operations related to `remove` does not explicitly remove the elements from the `values` array. Instead, it updates the size, min & max values only.
