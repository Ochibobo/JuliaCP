- Notice that the store works with values of Copy<T>
- However, BackUps only work with values of CopyEntry<T>
  - These values are restorable
  - These values are produced upon calling save on Copy<T>
  - They store the current value `v` of Copy<T> alongside Copy<T>
- We use object and not primitives so as to store a reference to the object on save instead of a copy of it - if we were to store primitives.
- The size of the prior grows per back up operation.
- The size of the store only grows based on the creation of new instances.
- Introduce IDs to state for duplication detection.
  - May be applicable at for the Copier's store.
